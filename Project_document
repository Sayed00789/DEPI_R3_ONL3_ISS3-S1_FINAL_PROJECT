Project Documentation 
Project Overview
• Project Name: Web &&Network Application Security Vulnerability Assessment.
• Description: Comprehensive black box penetration test of the Rabbit Store e commerce web app (TryHackMe lab) to identify, validate, and prioritize exploitable security weaknesses that could lead to customer data exposure, account takeover, or transaction tampering.
• Main Objectives:
1.	Enumerate the attack surface and discover vulnerabilities across auth, session, input handling, and access control.
2.	Safely demonstrate proof of exploitation (PoC) without damaging the lab environment.
3.	Provide actionable remediation steps mapped to OWASP and industry best practices.
• Scope of Testing: Primary web application (rabbitstore.thm) and any exposed APIs under the same host; in scope paths include /login, /register, /search, /cart, /checkout, /api/*. Network level enumeration is limited to the room assigned host(s). Third party services and DoS are out of scope.
• Tools and Technologies: Kali Linux, Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, Nmap, whatweb/httpx, gobuster/ffuf, Nikto, sqlmap, Hydra (rate limited), Wireshark/tcpdump, Python (requests/JWT), Bash utilities.

2)Testing Methodology
• Methodology Type: PTES (end to end phases) mapped to OWASP Testing Guide (WSTG) and informed by NIST SP 800 115.
Applied Flow: Pre engagement → Intelligence Gathering → Threat Modeling → Vulnerability Analysis → Exploitation (limited) → Post Exploitation (minimal) → Reporting & Re test.

3)Requirements
a. Functional Requirements
• Reconnaissance of domains/IPs, technologies, and endpoints.
• Vulnerability scanning and manual verification for false positive reduction.
• Controlled exploitation to confirm risk (within Rules of Engagement).
• Produce a report with severity ratings (CVSS v3.1), evidence, and remediation guidance.
b. Non Functional Requirements
• Safety: No disruptive payloads, no data exfiltration beyond PoC.
• Legal/Ethical: Comply with TryHackMe ToS and local laws.
• Evidence Hygiene: Timestamped screenshots, request/response logs, hashes for artifacts.
• Repeatability: Document commands, versions, and configuration for reproducibility.

4)Test Plan and Design
• Scope Definition:
•	In Scope assets: rabbitstore.thm, room IP (e.g., 10.10.x.x), app routes listed above.
•	Out of Scope: Third party services, unrelated hosts, DoS, social engineering, physical attacks.
• Rules of Engagement:
•	Time boxed testing within lab window; throttle automated tools.
•	Stop testing on signs of instability; immediately record suspected Critical/High.
•	Use only fake/test accounts and synthetic data.
• Attack Vectors:
• Web Application: SQL Injection, XSS (reflected/DOM), CSRF, IDOR/insecure direct object references, authentication bypass, weak session management/JWT issues, SSRF/RCE (tech dependent), security misconfiguration, sensitive data exposure, weak headers/TLS.
• Network: Port/service scanning, version detection, safe NSE scripts for HTTP/TLS enumeration; limited MITM only if explicitly permitted (not used in this lab).

5)Implementation Details
• Tool Configuration:
•	Nmap: -sC -sV -p- -Pn --version-all with selective --script http-* where safe.
•	Burp Suite: Proxy, Repeater, Intruder (rate limited), Logger/Comparer; match and replace templates for payload trials.
•	ZAP: Passive scan + targeted active scan on confirmed inputs.
•	sqlmap: Confirmed injection points only; time based/boolean techniques; DB enumeration restricted to schema banners/limited metadata.
• Custom Scripts/Modules:
•	idor_enumerator.py: Iterates /api/orders/{id} with auth token and checks for unauthorized responses.
•	jwt_linter.py: Validates signing algorithm usage (alg), audience/issuer/expiry claims; detects none/weak secret.

6)Execution and Findings
• Testing Phases: Recon → Scanning → Gaining Access → Maintaining Access (N/A for persistence in lab) → Covering Tracks (internal evidence organization only).
• Tools Used: Nmap, whatweb/httpx, gobuster/ffuf, Nikto, Burp/ZAP, sqlmap, Wireshark, Python/Bash scripts.
• Key Findings (Illustrative for this room):
1.	F 001: SQL Injection in /login (Critical, CVSS 9.8) — Time based payloads induced predictable delays; authentication bypass achievable. Impact: account takeover, potential data exposure. Fix: parameterized queries, prepared statements, least privilege DB role.
2.	F 002: IDOR on /api/orders/{id} (High, CVSS 8.7) — Authenticated user could read other users’ orders by changing numeric id. Fix: enforce server side authorization checks per object (ABAC/RBAC), deny by default.
3.	F 003: Reflected XSS at /search?q= (Medium, CVSS 6.1) — Unsanitized query echoed in HTML; session token at risk via DOM access if cookie flags weak. Fix: output encoding, strict input validation, CSP.
4.	F 004: Missing Security Headers (Low, CVSS 3.1) — No CSP/HSTS/X Frame Options; increases exploit surface. Fix: implement modern headers and harden TLS.
• Evidence Collected: Screenshots (#S 01…#S 20), HTTP requests/responses, PoC payloads, tool logs/hashes; retained locally per evidence policy.

7)Reporting and Delivery
• Report Format: PDF with Executive Summary, Technical Details per finding (steps to reproduce, impact, evidence, remediation), and Appendix (payloads/commands/versions).
• Delivery Instructions: Secure file transfer or encrypted email; share decryption password via out of band channel.
• Remediation Recommendations:
•	Injection: Use parameterized queries/ORM; centralize validation/encoding; WAF virtual patch as interim.
•	Access Control: Enforce server side checks on every object/action; implement least privilege and robust ID binding.
•	Sessions: HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite cookies; rotate on login/privilege change; short TTL; server side invalidation; strong JWT signing and claim validation.
•	Headers/TLS: CSP (default src 'none' + allowlists), HSTS, X Frame Options DENY, Referrer Policy; modern ciphers.
•	Secure SDLC: Add pre commit SAST, pipeline DAST on staging, secrets scanning, dependency checks.
